# Heart Disease Prediction Model :shipit:
This repository contains the Heart Disease Prediction Model developed for educational purposes as part of a tutorial course. The project demonstrates how machine learning models can be used for binary classification tasks such as predicting heart disease. The course includes step-by-step guides on everything from data loading to building and testing the model, as well as a simple GUI built using Tkinter.

## Project Overview
The heart disease prediction model is designed to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical features. This model was created using Scikit-learn, and the dataset has been carefully processed for demonstration purposes.

### Key Features
* Model: A machine learning model trained using various features such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.
* GUI: A Tkinter-based GUI to make heart disease predictions based on user input.
* Preprocessing: Data normalization using MinMaxScaler.
* Easter Eggs: There are some unnecessary methods used as part of the code for fun. Feel free to correct them if you like.
* Common Errors: Errors while coding are kept in the course to show common mistakes and how they can be solved.
* Basic Design: The GUI is simple, but you can find a more advanced version with Flask and MySQL in the linked repository below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The model is made in September 2024, so there might be version mismatches if you're running this on a different version of the software, which could cause errors. This is not my fault.
> * This project is purely for educational purposes and should not be used in real-life medical scenarios. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Bubu02/Heart_disease_Recognition_Model_NullCourse.git

Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Files
* `gui.py:` The main GUI application.
* `heart_disease_model.joblib:` The saved model used for predictions.
* `scaler.joblib:` The scaler used to normalize data.
* `README.md:` This file.
* `notes.txt:` Course notes and explanations.
* `requirements.txt:` List of all dependencies needed to run the project.
  
> [!TIP]
> ### Advanced Version
> For a more advanced version of this project with a Flask web app and MySQL integration, you can visit the following repository: Link to Advanced Project.

> [!WARNING]
> * There might be some mispronunciations in the course videos, but all concepts are clearly explained.
> * The simple GUI design was chosen to keep the course focused on machine learning, but advanced users can explore the Flask-based version.

### Suggestions
* Watch the video tutorials first, then follow along with the coding.
* Source code with notes is available in this repository for easy reference.
