# Heart Disease Recgnition Model :anatomical_heart:
This repository contains the Heart Disease Prediction Model developed for educational purposes as part of a tutorial course. The project demonstrates how machine learning models can be used for binary classification tasks such as predicting heart disease. The course includes step-by-step guides on everything from data loading to building and testing the model, as well as a simple GUI built using Tkinter.

## :seedling: Project Overview
The heart disease prediction model is designed to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical features. This model was created using Scikit-learn, and the dataset has been carefully processed for demonstration purposes.

> [!WARNING]
> * There might be some mispronunciations in the course videos, but all concepts are clearly explained.
> * This project is purely for educational purposes and should not be used in real-life medical scenarios. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.

### :star2: Key Features
* Model: A machine learning model trained using various features such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.
* GUI: A Tkinter-based GUI to make heart disease predictions based on user input.
* Preprocessing: Data normalization using MinMaxScaler.
* Easter Eggs: There are some unnecessary methods used as part of the code for fun. Feel free to correct them if you like.
* Common Errors: Errors while coding are kept in the course to show common mistakes and how they can be solved.
* Basic Design: The GUI is simple, but you can find a more advanced version with Flask and MySQL in the linked repository below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The model is made in September 2024, so there might be version mismatches if you're running this on a different version of the software, which could cause errors. This is not my fault.
> * The simple GUI design was chosen to keep the course focused on machine learning, but advanced users can explore the Flask-based version.
